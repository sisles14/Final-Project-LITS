The Lost In The Screen homepage is meant to show an overview of all the movies I've watched and liked. When you click one of the movies, it opens up a modal that showcases the movie poster, the description, and the genre(s).

The Cast & Directors page titled "Behind the Scenes", showcases the directors, actors, and voice actors in all of these movies. When you click the profile of these people, you get sent to the modal of that person's corresponding movie. For example, if you click Margot Robbie's, the modal for the Barbie movie will open up.

The Contact & Credits page showcases the credits for the trailers, the icons, and the color thief library. This page also showcases my name, and a brief description about the project.
